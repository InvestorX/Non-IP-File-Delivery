## Executive Summary

### Implementation Status Overview

| Category | Count | Percentage | Description |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ **Fully Implemented** | 12 | 52% | Production-ready, fully functional |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Standalone Tools** | 2 | 9% | Complete but not integrated with main system |
| üî∂ **Partial Implementation** | 5 | 22% | Basic functionality works, extensions needed |
| ‚ùå **Not Implemented** | 4 | 17% | Unimplemented or stub/logging only |

**Total**: 23 major features analyzed

### Key Findings

#### üéâ Positive Discoveries (Underestimated in README)

1. **FTP Data Channel** - README states "unimplemented", but it's **fully implemented** (704 lines)
2. **GUI Configuration Tool** - Not mentioned in README, but **WPF version is fully implemented** (613 lines)
3. **RetryPolicy** - README states "unverified", but it's **integrated in SecureEthernetTransceiver**
4. **QoSFrameQueue** - README states "unverified", but it's **integrated in SecureEthernetTransceiver**

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concerns (Overestimated in README)

1. **File Storage Processing** - File chunk reception exists, but actual file saving is unimplemented
2. **Automatic Failover** - TODO comment remains in code
3. **Retransmission Control (ACK/NAK)** - README states "implemented" but it's actually **unimplemented**
4. **Bandwidth Control** - README states "implemented" but only priority control exists
